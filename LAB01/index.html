<h3>
Web Browser and Web Servers
</h3>
<p>
In order for the Web to work you need web browsers and web servers which work hand in hand.
The web browser is a piece of software that is used to interpret the information found in an
HTML document and display the content of that document based upon the HTML tags found
within it. A web server is a computer that stores HTML documents, otherwise known as web
pages, and waits for connections from web browsers. When a web browser connects to a web
server, the web server sends the requested document, if it exists, back to the web browser for
display.
